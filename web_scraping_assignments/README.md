# Fandom Wiki Scraping Assignment

## Fandom Wiki Choice: University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) Page

I chose to scrape the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign page because of my personal connection to the university as a student and my interest in gathering institutional data about its history, size, and affiliations. The data I plan to scrape, such as the establishment date, enrollment numbers, and research activities, could be valuable to researchers in the field of higher education studies, institutional research, or historical analysis of public universities.

## Data Scraped:
I am scraping data like:
- Year of establishment
- University motto
- Enrollment numbers
- Academic staff and administrative staff details
- Campus size and affiliations
- Key university leadership (Chancellor, President)

## robots.txt:
