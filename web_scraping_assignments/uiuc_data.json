It is the flagship institution of the University of Illinois system and was founded in 1867. Enrolling over 56,000 undergraduate and graduate students, the University of Illinois is one of the largest public universities by enrollment in the country.",
        "The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is a member of the Association of American Universities and is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities \u2013 Very high research activity\".[14] In fiscal year 2019, research expenditures at Illinois totaled $652 million.[15][16] The campus library system possesses the fourth-largest university library in the United States by holdings. [17] The university also hosts the National Center for Supercomputing Applications and is home to the fastest supercomputer on a university campus.[18]",
        "The university contains 16 schools and colleges[19] and offers more than 150 undergraduate and over 100 graduate programs of study. The university holds 651 buildings on 6,370 acres (2,578\u00a0ha)[11] and its annual operating budget in 2016 was over $2 billion.[20] The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign also operates a Research Park home to innovation centers for over 90 start-up companies and multinational corporations, including Abbott, AbbVie, Caterpillar, Capital One, Dow, State Farm, John Deere, GSI, and Yahoo, among others.[16]",

        "The University of Illinois, originally named \"Illinois Industrial University\", was one of the 37 universities created under the first Morrill Land-Grant Act, which provided public land for the creation of agricultural and industrial colleges and universities across the United States. Among several cities, Urbana was selected in 1867 as the site for the new school.[22][23] From the beginning, President John Milton Gregory's desire to establish an institution firmly grounded in the liberal arts tradition was at odds with many state residents and lawmakers who wanted the university to offer classes based solely around \"industrial education\".[24] The university opened for classes on March 2, 1868, and had two faculty members and 77 students.[25]",
        "John Milton Gregory, the university's first president",
        "The Library, which opened with the school in 1868, started with 1,039 volumes. Subsequently, President Edmund J. James, in a speech to the board of trustees in 1912, proposed to create a research library. It is now one of the world's largest public academic collections.[23][26][27] In 1870, the Mumford House was constructed as a model farmhouse for the school's experimental farm. The Mumford House remains the oldest structure on campus.[28] The original University Hall (1871) was the fourth building built; it stood where the Illini Union stands today.[29]",
        "In 1885, the Illinois Industrial University officially changed its name to the \"University of Illinois\", reflecting its agricultural, mechanical, and liberal arts curriculum.[24]",
        "During his presidency, Edmund J. James (1904\u20131920) is credited for building the foundation for the large Chinese international student population on campus.[30][31][32][33] James established ties with China through the Chinese Minister to the United States Wu Ting-Fang.[33] In addition, during James's presidency, class rivalries and Bob Zuppke's winning football teams contributed to campus morale.[23]",

        "The Great Depression slowed construction and expansion on the campus. The university replaced the original university hall with Gregory Hall and the Illini Union. After World War II, the university experienced rapid growth. The enrollment doubled and the academic standing improved.[35]  This period was also marked by large growth in the Graduate College and increased federal support of scientific and technological research. During the 1950s and 1960s the university experienced the turmoil common on many American campuses. Among these were the water fights of the fifties and sixties.[36]",
        "By 1967, the University of Illinois system consisted of a main campus in Champaign-Urbana and two Chicago campuses, Chicago Circle (UICC) and Medical Center (UIMC), and people began using \"Urbana-Champaign\" or the reverse to refer to the main campus specifically. The university name officially changed to the \"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\" by 1977. While this was a reversal of the commonly used designation for the metropolitan area (Champaign-Urbana), most of the campus is located in Urbana. The name change established a separate identity for the main campus within the University of Illinois system, which today includes campuses in Springfield (UIS) and Chicago (UIC) (formed by the merger of UICC and UIMC).",
        "In 1998, the Hallene Gateway Plaza was dedicated. The Plaza features the original sandstone portal of University Hall, which was originally the fourth building on campus.[29] In recent years, state support has declined from 4.5% of the state's tax appropriations in 1980 to 2.28% in 2011, a nearly 50% decline.[37]  As a result, the university's budget has shifted away from relying on state support with nearly 84% of the budget coming from other sources in 2012.[38]",
        "On March 12, 2015, the Board of Trustees approved the creation of a medical school, the first college created at Urbana-Champaign in 60 years.[39][40][41] The Carle Illinois College of Medicine began classes in 2018.[42]",
        "Over the last twenty years state funding for the university has fallen. Private philanthropy increasingly supplements revenue from tuition and state funding, providing about 19% of the annual budget in 2012.[38] Notable among significant donors, alumnus entrepreneur Thomas M. Siebel has committed nearly $150 million to the university, including $36 million to build the Thomas M. Siebel Center for Computer Science and $25 million to build the Siebel Center for Design. Further the Grainger Foundation (founded by alumnus W. W. Grainger) has contributed more than $300 million to the university over the last half-century,[citation needed] including donations for the construction of the Grainger Engineering Library. Larry Gies and his wife Beth donated $150 million in 2017 to the shortly thereafter renamed Gies College of Business.[43]",

In August 2005, the National Collegiate Athletic Association expressed disapproval of the university's use of a \"hostile or abusive\" image.[177] While initially proposing a consensus approach to the decision about the Chief, the board in 2007 decided that the Chief, its name, image and regalia should be officially retired. Nevertheless, the controversy continues on campus with some students unofficially maintaining the Chief. Complaints continue that indigenous students feel insulted when images of the Chief continue to be present on campus.[178] The effort to resolve the controversy has included the work of a committee, which issued a report of its \"critical conversations\" that included over 600 participants representing all sides.[179]",
