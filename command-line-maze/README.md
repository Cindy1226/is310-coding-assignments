# Corn Maze

Welcome to the Expanded Corn Maze! Your goal is to navigate through the directories and find the exit.

## Instructions
1. Start at the `entrance` directory.
2. You may take either `path1` or `path4`. `Path4` leads to a detour.
3. Follow the clues found in each file to guide you through the maze.
4. The exit can be found in the `exit` directory inside `path3`.
5. The `hidden` directory contains additional clues but is not necessary to solve the maze.

Good luck!
