# Pandas EDA Assignment

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks:

NationalParksEDA.ipynb: An in-class exercise exploring National Park visits in the United States from 1979 to 2020.
AverageRatingsByLanguageAndGenre.ipynb: An individual project analyzing the impact of the original language and genre of books on their average Goodreads rating.
Data Sources
NationalParksEDA.ipynb
National Park Visits Data (1979-2020)

Objective of this EDA
The main objective of this project is to analyze how the original language and genre of a book affect its average Goodreads rating. By visualizing the data, we can uncover patterns that may reflect cultural preferences, universal themes, or the popularity of certain genres among readers. This analysis helps in understanding potential biases in ratings and how they are distributed across genres and languages.

What I Did for This Assignment
NationalParksEDA.ipynb (In-Class Exercise)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I performed basic data cleaning tasks, such as handling missing values, filtering data, and ensuring proper data types for analysis.
Data Analysis: I analyzed trends in National Park visits over time by state. This involved looking at state-wise visitation patterns and identifying significant changes or trends in visitor numbers.
Visualization: I created various visualizations to help understand trends and insights from the data. This included time series graphs to see how visitation numbers changed over the years, as well as state-specific bar charts to visualize the data by state.
AverageRatingsByLanguageAndGenre.ipynb (Individual Data Analysis and Visualization)
Data Cleaning: I cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and ensuring that the columns were properly formatted for analysis.
Analysis: I grouped the dataset by the original language and genre of books and calculated the average Goodreads rating for each group. This allowed me to explore patterns in ratings across different genres and languages.
Visualization: I used visualizations, including bar charts and scatter plots, to highlight the relationship between language, genre, and average rating. These visualizations helped identify trends in book ratings, such as whether certain languages or genres tend to receive higher ratings.
Project Structure
NationalParksEDA.ipynb: Contains the code for performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the National Park visits dataset, including cleaning, transforming, and visualizing the data.
AverageRatingsByLanguageAndGenre.ipynb: Analyzes the Goodreads ratings of books, grouping them by their language and genre to investigate the factors that influence their ratings.
